# Practice Exercise - Linux Package Management

Welcome to the package management practice exercise! By now, you've learned essential package management commands on the Linux command line. This exercise will test your understanding and ability to use those commands effectively. Let's get started!

**Scenario**:  
You are setting up a new Linux workstation for software development, and you need to prepare the environment.

## Task 1: Searching for Packages

1. Search for the package `git` in your repository.
2. While you're at it, see if there's a package named `nodejs`.

## Task 2: Installing Packages

1. Install the package `git`.
2. Search for a text editor named `vim` and install it.
3. Look for the package `curl` and ensure it gets installed on your system.

## Task 3: Listing Installed Packages

1. List all the installed packages on your system.
2. From the list, can you identify if `wget` is installed?

## Task 4: Updating Packages

1. Ensure your package list is updated.
2. Upgrade all the packages on your system to their latest versions.
3. Specifically check if there's an update available for `curl` and update it, if possible.

## Task 5: Removing Packages

1. Realizing that you prefer other text editors over `vim`, remove the `vim` package.
2. Also, remove the package `nano` if it's installed.
3. After removal, ensure that the packages were indeed removed by listing the installed packages.

## Task 6: Clean-up

1. Some packages might leave behind configuration files when removed. Fully purge `vim` to ensure no configuration files are left.
2. Check if there are any unnecessary packages (those that were dependencies but aren't needed anymore) and remove them.
