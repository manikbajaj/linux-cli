# Solution: Text Editing

### Step 1: Normalize Text with `tr`

**Convert all uppercase letters to lowercase:**

```bash
tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' < draft.txt > temp1.txt
```

This command reads `draft.txt`, converts all uppercase characters to lowercase, and saves the output to `temp1.txt`.

**Convert Windows line endings (CRLF) to Unix line endings (LF):**

```bash
tr -d '\r' < temp1.txt > temp2.txt
```

This command removes the carriage return characters from `temp1.txt` and saves the result to `temp2.txt`.

### Step 2: Format Text with `sed`

**Convert British English 'colour' to American English 'color':**

```bash
sed 's/colour/color/g' temp2.txt > temp3.txt
```

This `sed` command substitutes the word 'colour' with 'color' globally in `temp2.txt` and outputs to `temp3.txt`.

**Correct 'web site' to 'website':**

```bash
sed 's/web site/website/g' temp3.txt > draft_corrected.txt
```

This `sed` command substitutes 'web site' with 'website' globally in `temp3.txt` and outputs to `draft_corrected.txt`.

### Step 3: Spell Checking with `aspell`

**Check `draft_corrected.txt` for spelling mistakes:**

```bash
aspell check draft_corrected.txt
```

This command starts an interactive spell-checking session with `draft_corrected.txt`. As you go through each potential spelling error, `aspell` will suggest corrections. You can choose to ignore, replace, or add each word to the dictionary as needed.

Once you've gone through all suggestions and made the necessary corrections, `aspell` will save the changes to `draft_corrected.txt` directly.

**Rename the file to `final.txt`:**

```bash
mv draft_corrected.txt final.txt
```

Now you have the file `final.txt` with all the corrections made.

**Expected `final.txt` Content:**

To summarize, the commands to use in sequence would be:

```bash
tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' < draft.txt > temp1.txt
tr -d '\r' < temp1.txt > temp2.txt
sed 's/colour/color/g' temp2.txt > temp3.txt
sed 's/web site/website/g' temp3.txt > draft_corrected.txt
aspell check draft_corrected.txt
mv draft_corrected.txt final.txt
```

This sequence of commands demonstrates the use of `tr` for case conversion and line ending normalization, `sed` for pattern substitution, and `aspell` for interactive spell checking. The commands create a series of temporary files (`temp1.txt`, `temp2.txt`, `temp3.txt`) to preserve the intermediate results. Finally, the `mv` command is used to rename the corrected file to `final.txt`.
